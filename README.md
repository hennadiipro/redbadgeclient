# Caster

Caster is a specific prospecting tool for the sales team of Casted. It was created for them because it's a huge time suck identifying potential customers who do have a
B2B podcast because there are many folks that work at large enterprises that have their own shows, but our software was specifically built for the B2B marketer. 
Caster will allow the sales team to gain more time back by easily searching for companies they want to get into and disqualifying or qualifying them to fit within
our Ideal Customer Profile. 

# Motivation

The motivation for this project came from spending too much time in my full-time work identifying customers that would benefit from our software. Caster would allow
me to hit my monthly quota and be more efficient in my line of work. Did somebody say bonus? :)

There are many ways I can make this app even more user friendly, but had to call it at this point. At its current stage, the team will be able to quickly run through
a list of prospects to search for a show and start reaching out to them!
