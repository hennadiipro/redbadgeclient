# Caster

Caster is a specific prospecting tool for the sales team of Casted. It was created for them because it's a huge time suck identifying potential customers who do have a
B2B podcast because there are many folks that work at large enterprises that have their own shows, but our software was specifically built for the B2B marketer. 
Caster will allow the sales team to gain more time back by easily searching for companies they want to get into and disqualifying or qualifying them to fit within
our Ideal Customer Profile. 

# Motivation

The motivation for this project came from spending too much time in my full-time work identifying customers that would benefit from our software. Caster would allow
me to hit my monthly quota and be more efficient in my line of work. Did somebody say bonus? :)

There are many ways I can make this app even more user friendly, but had to call it at this point. At its current stage, the team will be able to quickly run through
a list of prospects to search for a show and start reaching out to them!

# Code style

js-standard-style

# Tech/Framework Used

Built the server side with Node.js and the client side with Legacy React and Typescript. The Application is deployed to Heroku with a cloud instance of Postgres.

# Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
